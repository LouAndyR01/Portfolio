                    <p>My name is Louis Rodriguez, I am a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp student through Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. I was Born and raised in Dallas, with a small stint in Austin.</P> 
                    <p>I have been in the mortgage industry for 14 years and now looking to make a transition to programming to challenge myself. I feel like I have learned quite a bit of coding through the class so far, but I know I have only seen the tip of the iceberg.</p>
                    <p>When I am not in front of a computer coding or drawing up numbers for clients, I have quite a few hobbies.  My favorite hobbies include hiking, camping, going to music shows and most of all, traveling and learning about other cultures.</p>
                    <p>My highest hike to date is Longs Peak in Estes Park, Colorado.  It is my only 15'er up to date, and I have several long hikes under my belt. My favorite hike so far has been the Grand Canyon, but I have plans to visit Zion and Yosemite this year. My ulitmate goal it to hike the Pacific Crest Trail or the Appalachian Trail one season.</p>
                    <p>My goal after I complete my bootcamp studies is to begin a career in programming that will allow me to satisfy one of my other passions, traveling.</p>
