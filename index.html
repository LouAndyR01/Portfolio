                <p>Born and raised in Dallas, with a small stint in Austin.  I graduated from DeSoto high school in 1993 and attended Texas Tech University. I have been in the real estate for 14 years, now looking to make a transition to programming to challenge myself. My favorite hobbies include, hiking, camping, going to music shows and most of all, traveling and learning about other cultures.
